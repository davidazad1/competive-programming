# Debug Template For `CPP`
if you want something easy to setup and use for debugging, this header is for you.


there is all headers of `<bits/stdc++.h>` in this file for `clang` compiler (it doesn't support `<bits/stdc++.h>`).
if you are using `g++`, remove theme.


## how to use
1. copy the file in same folder as you `.cpp` file.
2. copy and past the comment on top of file.
